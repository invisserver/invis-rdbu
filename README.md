invis Server Backup Solution

invis-rdbu is a backup solution for invis-Servers. It is based on the combination of rdiff-backup and LVM-snapshots.
It ist possible to use USB-Disks or other servers as backup-targets.

In case of using USB-Disks as backup targets, invis-rdbu is using UDEV to recognize its target an starting the backup.

Have fun.
